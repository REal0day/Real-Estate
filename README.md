#### RoE (Return on Equity)

```
RoE = (NE - OE) / OE
```
Return on Equity = (New Equity - Original Equity) / Original Equity

NE: New Equity produced by a sale
OE: Original Equity in the property at the time of purchase.

1. Calculate the Equity in the property when you invested
2. Calculate the equity in the property when sold.

```
E = FMV - MPO - L - OD
```
E: Your Equity in the property
FMV: Fair Market Value of the property + Closing Costs
MPO: Mortgage Payoff Amount
L: Liens on the property. A Lien in the right to keep possession of property belonging to another person until a debt owed by that person is discharged.
OD: Other Debts on the Property

Example)
Buy a Duplex for $210k, $5k in closing costs paying $50k down aka 23.809% down, and getting $160k mortgage, then the equity in the property is $55.
FMV = $210k + $5k
MPO = $160k
L = 0
OD = 0
```
E = FMV - MPO - L - OD
$210k - $50k
