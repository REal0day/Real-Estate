#### RoE (Return on Equity)

```
RoE = (NE - OE) / OE
```
Return on Equity = (New Equity - Original Equity) / Original Equity

NE: New Equity produced by a sale
OE: Original Equity in the property at the time of purchase.

1. Calculate the Equity in the property when you invested
2. Calculate the equity in the property when sold.

```
E = FMV - MPO - L - OD

Equity = (Fair Market Value of the property + Closing Costs) - (Mortgage Payoff Amount) - (Liens) - (Other Debts on the Property)
```
E: Your Equity in the property
FMV: Fair Market Value of the property + Closing Costs
MPO: Mortgage Payoff Amount
L: Liens on the property. A Lien in the right to keep possession of property belonging to another person until a debt owed by that person is discharged.
OD: Other Debts on the Property

Example)
Buy a Duplex for $210k, $5k in closing costs paying $50k down aka 23.809% down, and getting $160k mortgage, then the equity in the property is $55.
FMV = $210k + $5k
MPO = $160k
L = 0
OD = 0
```
E = FMV - MPO - L - OD
$210k - $50k

```

After Renovation Value
```ARV = Property's Current Value + Value of Renovations
```

Appreciation
```
(Present Value - Original Value) / Original Value
$400k Fourplex a year ago, and now it's worth $426,800
A = ($426,800 - $400k) / $400k
A = $26,800 / $400k
A = 0.067
It's apprecaited 6.7%
```

Future Value Calculation
````Future Value = Present Value * (1 + Percentage Increase Factor)
$400k Fourplex and we know the appreciation rate is 6.7%
```
